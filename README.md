# ML-Full-Stack-Interview
Welcome to the ML full stack developer interview. In this interview, there will be three tasks. 

* **Task 1**: Deploy and Run a Jupyter Notebook Server
* **Task 2**: Data Analysis
* **Task 3**: Presenting Data
  * Option 1: Python Data Visualisation
  * Option 2: Webpage Deployment

### ğŸ’¡
> We believe that solving problems by searching for information online is an important skill you will use throughout your life as a software developer. Therefore, **you are free to Google search** for any technical documentation or any other open resources you may require during this interview. 

> Feel free to use any IDE, shell or any other tools if you want. We are not testing if you can use some tool that you have never used before.

We also prepared a [handbook](#handbook) in this document which discusses some commonly seen issues. 

## Task 0: Preparation

Before you start, please check your public IP address and send it to the interviewer. This is needed to whitelist your public IP to grant access to our remote servers. Your data will be deleted immediately after the interview finishes. 

>You can do so by running ```curl ifconfig.me``` in your terminal or simply open [https://ifconfig.me/](https://ifconfig.me/ "ifconfig") in your web browser. 

## Task 1: Deploy a Remote Jupyter Notebook Server

In this task, you will need to set up a Jupyter Notebook on a remote server, and make sure all dependencies and requirements are satisfied. You are free to connect to the remote Jupyter server notebook via your web browser, or via an IDE like VS Code, depending on what you're more comfortable with.

#### Server system
By default, you will be provided a Ubuntu operating system on the remote instance. If you prefer another flavour of Linux, let us know.

#### Login
The remote serverâ€™s public IP address is one of the following:

* `3.73.106.177`
* `3.75.58.222`

### ğŸ’¡
> Please note that the server's public IP above is a **static** IP address, so you are free to access it via your `~/.ssh/config`if you wish.

Your username for the instance will be `ubuntu` (if using Ubuntu).

The private key for ssh access to the instance is provided in this repository. The file name is `interview.pem`.

You'll need to use `ssh` to connect to the remote server. You can use terminal (if you are using MacOS or Linux), powershell or WSL (if you are using Windows) or any other standalone ssh tools such as PuTTY or WinSCP to move data between your local machine and the remote. 

#### Requirements
You may need to set up an Jupyter Notebook server with secured login (if connecting via a web browser), so that end users are able to login in to your notebook server more securely with a passcode through a web browser. 

By default, Python is the language to be used in the notebook server. However, you could also plug-in any other language kernels, such as Java, Scala, JS, etc. 

Apart from the programming language, you should also set up a working environment for tasks 2 and 3. The notebook server you set up will be used for the subsequent tasks in this exercise. Have a look at the following tasks, and decide what additional packages you need.


## Task 2: Data Analysis

In this task, you will need to write a program to analyse the world's billionaires' data. 
The data is stored in the file `billionaires.csv`

In order to get this file on the remote server, you need to clone this repo to the remote server. 

#### Data explanation
The Forbes Dataset comprises 2,750 people whose net worth equals or exceeds 1 billion US Dollars.

Columns Descriptions:

1. Name: Name of the person or family name
2. Networth: Expressed in billions of USD
3. Country
4. Source: main source from which the wealth originated
5. Age
6. Residence: In the format of `City, State` or `City, Country`
7. Citizenship
8. Status: Marital status
9. Children: Number of children
10. Education: Educational institution degree was acquired from
11. Self_made: (True/False) origin of wealth
12. Geolocation: Location of primary residence

> Note that only some columns are used in this task.

#### Your Tasks

In your Jupyter notebook, perform the following tasks. Don't forget to add markdown cells in your notebook indicating the start of each subtask below!

1. Let a user type in a column name, and then sort (either in ascending or descending order) the entire table based on the input value.
1. Count the number of billionaires in each country (using either the "Country" or the "Citizenship" column). Output each country name along with the count.
1. Group all rows based on sector/industry (the "Source" column). Then generate a new table which contains only the top 3 people with the highest net worth in each sector/industry. 
### ğŸ’¡ Keep in mind
* This file is encoded using 'utf-8' character set. You may need to specify this encoding when reading in the file.
* Code readability matters! Bonus points for formatting/linting your code (yes, even within a Jupyter notebook) in a way that makes it more readable to other developers.

## Task 3: Presenting Data

In this task, you'll need to present the data you just analysed. You may choose one from the two options. 


### Option 1: Python Data Visualisation

In this task, you'll need to use a python visualisation library to display data. We recommend to use `matplotlib` or `seaborn`. 

#### Your Task

Use the result of the third subtask in task 2, i.e. counting the number of billionaires in each country. Generate a bar chart, a line chart and a pie chart to display the number of billionaires (y axis) against countries (x axis). 

- For the bar chart, order the data based on the count in **descending** order. 

- For the line chart, order the data based on country names in **ascending** order. 

### Option 2: Webpage Deployment

In this task, you'll host a web page to display the data to a non-technical audience. We recommend using any of the following frameworks: 

- Apache
- Nginx
- Tomcat
- Node.js
- Flask
- Django

#### Your Task
Use the result of the third subtask in task 2, i.e. counting the number of billionaires in each country. Generate a table in your webpage. The table should contain two columns: country and count.

- If you are deploying a *static* web page, please export your result from Python to a JSON file and use JavaScript (or any other web-friendly language) to read the file and generate a table. 

- If you are deploying a *dynamic* web page using Flask or Django, please make a template of the web page with holes and fill in the holes with data in Flask or Django. 


## Handbook

Below, we list some issues that you may encounter:

### Permissions for `{key_name}` are too open

If you are running ssh on Windows, you might see the following error when you try to connect to the remote server:

```
C:\>ssh ubuntu@{DNS} -i {key name}
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions for '{key name}' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "{key name}": bad permissions
ubuntu@{DNS}: Permission denied (publickey).
```

If you are running ssh on MacOS or Linux, you might see the following error when you try to connect to the remote server:

```
$:ssh ubuntu@{DNS} -i {key name}
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0644 for '{key name}' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "{key name}": bad permissions
Permission denied (publickey).
```

As in many other situations, you are free to look at StackOverflow to obtain answers.

### Unable to clone repo on the remote server

If you are trying to download the dataset file but you are unable to clone this repo on the remote server due to ssh permission issues, you may need to clone it to your own machine and use `scp` to transfer the file through ssh. 


### Jupyter not found after successful installation of jupyter notebook

There are various reasons causing this problem. The most possible one is that jupyter is not added to your bash $PATH. 

Try to figure out the path to `jupyter` that you just installed and add it the path to $PATH
